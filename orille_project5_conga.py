"""

This program uses classes and the dudraw window to draw a circle on the screen with a random color.
A circle first appears when you hit the 'n' key for the first time.  This circle will continue following
the mouse's current position.  Afterward's if you hit 'n' again, more circles will appear and begin following
the previous circle in the line.  It looks like a conga line.
